# GAUSSIAN TREE MODELS OF GENE LENGTH EVOLUTION (Models for Complex Systems - Exam Project)

## Abstract:

In this exam project, we explored the computation of ancestral hierarchies for a list of species using Gaussian Tree Models. The primary objective was to efficiently simulate and infer gene length evolution by leveraging a structured Bayesian network approach. By encoding relationships between parent and child nodes based on given data, we constructed a Gaussian tree model that systematically traces evolutionary histories.

Our approach involved forward simulation using breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse the tree structure, allowing us to simulate gene lengths efficiently. We implemented inference algorithms, including Gaussian Belief Propagation, to compute the conditional distributions of hidden nodes given observed data. Additionally, we applied linear regression to learn model parameters from simulated data and tested our algorithms on both simulated and real datasets.

The results demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods, with predictions closely matching ground truth values. This project highlights the potential of Gaussian Tree Models in reducing computational complexity and providing insights into gene length evolution through probabilistic modeling.
